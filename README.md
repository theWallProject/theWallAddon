Welcome to theWall.
This is a [Plasmo extension](https://docs.plasmo.com/) project bootstrapped with [`plasmo init`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plasmo).

## Why?

The plugin is a simple black-list based detector of websites enabeling the worlds worst killing machine - the Israeli government.
This is not a tool to spread hate, it aims to spread knowledge. Users are free to proceed to those websites after knowing.

## How it works

The plugin checks the URL of the current tab against a verified list of domains. If the domain is found in the list, the plugin displays a popup.

For most domains, a simple check against the domain is enough. However, for "special" websites like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. We check page Ids.
The source of this data is crunchbase so it's 100% accurate.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and load the appropriate development build. For example, if you are developing for the chrome browser, using manifest v3, use: `build/chrome-mv3-dev`.

## Making production build

Run the following:

```bash
npm run build
```

This should create a production bundle for your extension, ready to be zipped and published to the stores.
